# DIRECTED INTELLIGENCE  
## Swell GSO 2026 Roadmap  
**Utilizing the fundamentals of Technical SEO and Generative Engine Optimization to build unbreakable authority inside LLM citation engines.**

### 01 // THE ARCHITECT  
**GEO Strategy & Entity Architecture**  

We design the foundational blueprint that turns brands into primary sources for large language models.  

- Entity mapping across Google’s Knowledge Graph + emerging LLM graphs  
- JSON-LD schema orchestration (Dataset, Organization, Article, HowTo, FAQPage + custom Swell extensions)  
- Semantic core content clusters engineered for zero-hallucination citation  
- Prompt-testing protocol against GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0, and Perplexity  

**Deliverable:** 90-day GSO Architecture Deck + live schema validator dashboard

### 02 // THE PULSE  
**Sentiment & Forum Authority Layer**  

We don’t chase backlinks — we direct sentiment where LLMs actually listen.  

- High-signal forum orchestration (Reddit, Quora, specialized industry boards)  
- Real-time mention monitoring + response playbook  
- Creator & KOL co-authorship program for first-hand E-E-A-T signals  
- Zero-spam authority stacking that LLMs reward  

**Deliverable:** Monthly Pulse Report showing exact citation velocity inside AI answers

- Schema-embedded visualizations (Plotly + Swell custom components)  
- Mobile-first spatial fluidity that reduces bounce and increases dwell time  

**Deliverable:** Production-ready Webflow site or component library with 100 % schema compliance
